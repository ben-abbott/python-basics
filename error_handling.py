"""
Exceptions need to be handled from the most specific at the top
to least specific at the bottom - remember the shape analogy!
try should only contain the code that is likely to produce the exception.
Otherwise you risk not executing some parts of the code!
The finally block is often used for cleaning up - nulling values,
closing files/database connections etc
